In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.

Whisk in the milk and vegetable oil until all ingredients are combined and batter has no clumps.

Pour batter into a microwave-safe mug. You want enough head space for the cake to rise without pouring over.

Add hazelnut chocolate spread in the middle of the batter or mini chocolate chips. Just drop it in the middle, no need to push it down and sink it in the batter. It does that on its own when it cooks!

Place a paper towel into the microwave and set the mug on top (just in case the batter overflows).

Microwave mug cake for 1-2 minutes.

Carefully remove from microwave and enjoy!
